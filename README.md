Dice Game Rules:
1.	Starting the Game:
  •	The game starts with Player 1 as the active player.
2.	Rolling the Dice:
  •	The active player rolls the dice.
  •	If the dice shows a number between 2 and 6:
  •	This number is added to the active player's current score.
  •	If the dice shows the number 1:
  •	The active player's current score is reset to 0.
  •	The turn immediately switches to the other player.
3.	Holding:
  •	At any point during their turn, the active player can choose to hold.
  •	When holding, the active player's current score is added to their total score.
  •	The turn then switches to the other player.
4.	Winning the Game:
  •	The first player to reach the predetermined total score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
5.	New Game:

  •	Pressing this button resets both players' total and current scores to 0, and Player 1 becomes the active player.
Gameplay Flow:
1.	Player 1 starts and rolls the dice:
  •	If the result is 2-6, the score is added to Player 1's current score.
  •	If the result is 1, Player 1's current score resets to 0, and Player 2 becomes the active player.
2.	Player 1 decides whether to roll again or hold:
  •	If Player 1 holds, the current score is added to the total score, and Player 2 becomes the active player.
3.	Player 2 repeats the same process as Player 1.
4.	Turns alternate between players until one player's total score reaches the winning threshold.
